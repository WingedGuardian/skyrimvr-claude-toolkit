# Changelog

## v2.0

### New Capabilities
- **ESP editing via Spriggit** — Serialize any ESP to human-readable YAML, edit directly, deserialize back. Now the primary recommended workflow for record editing.
- **AutoMod CLI integration** — NIF mesh inspection and editing, BSA archive CRUD, audio file processing (FUZ/XWM/WAV), and MCM menu generation via SpookyPirate's AutoMod Toolkit.
- **Save file analysis** — New `scripts/read-save.py` + `skyrim-save` skill. Decompress .ess saves, extract the full plugin list, search for orphaned scripts, detect effect accumulation, check mod footprint, and monitor save bloat over time.
- **8 Claude Code skills** — Auto-loading slash commands: `/inspect-esp`, `/port-to-vr`, `/create-mod`. Auto-context for NIFs, BSAs, audio files, save files, and general Skyrim modding context.

### Changes
- Version-agnostic: fully supports SE, AE, VR, and LE. Not VR-exclusive despite VR origins.
- Framing updated to reflect actual strengths: power user tool for porting, debugging, and editing — complex mods from scratch require iteration.
- Setup prompt updated to include AutoMod CLI as an optional install.
- Knowledgebase expanded with save file format documentation.
- README reordered: porting and debugging examples now lead; new-mod-from-scratch examples follow with honest caveats.
